## Introduction

Sleep has been seen to be important in the health of humans. It is a basic requirement for healthy living alongside food, water and shelter.
Poor Sleep health has been noted to negatively affect the wellbeing of individuals. A human is expected to sleep between 6-8 hours daily. However, different people have been observed to sleep below the required minimum. Hence, the purpose of this analysis.
This analysis is aimed at showing various insights in regard to sleep health and lifestyle.
The sleep disorders evaluated in this project were Insomnia and Sleep Apnea.
Insomnia- this is characterized by difficulty in sleeping. This can be in the form of not being able to sleep at all or constantly waking up and not being able to sleep back even when the opportunity to sleep is there.
Sleep Apnea- this is repeated pauses  and interruptions while breathing  during sleep hours.


## Executive Summary

In this project, it was discovered that men have more occurrences of short sleep. The possible factors that could lead to this are financial difficulties, frequency of depression, constant family issues, high stress level and having multiple sources of income. They should be a targeted awareness for the male gender. This could be done mainly in male units in the hospitals, clinics etc.
The majority of patients in the Early Middle Age (35-44 years) who were examined were noted to have hypertension stage 1. This could be due to various lifestyle factors such as alcohol, smoking, poor exercise etc. Other factors that could possibly increase the risk of hypertension stage 1 in early middle age were marriage issues, depression, poor feeding lifestyle, constant quest for money etc. 
Furthermore, as seen in Figure 1, Nurses were seen to be having a high occurrence of Sleep Apnea. This could be attributed to constant night shifts, long hours of standing and obesity. However, it was also discovered that the majority of the doctors examined did not have a sleep disorder. This could be attributed to the fact that they are highly knowledgeable of preventive methods of sleep disorders.

## Deeper Insights

Nurses are the leading occupation with sleep apnea (78%). This was attributed to being overweight and high stress level and high physical activity. Majority of the nurses examined had Stage 2 hypertension.
About 59% of Male were noted to have short sleep leading to 91% of insomnia cases. This can be attributed to high stress levels.
The young adults (27-34 years) were having an extremely high number of short sleeps. This was due to high stress levels and high occurrence of hypertension stage 1.
92% of hypertension stage 1 patients had insomnia. This could be attributed to their age as the majority of them were in the early middle age(35-44 years).
78% of stage 2 hypertension patients have Sleep Apnea. This was because of their age as the majority were filled with older adults (55 -59 years).
Recommendation
Sleep Health advocacy – this should be carried out constantly in the hospital to enlighten the public on the importance of good sleep health.
Public Health Professionals should create awareness for the male and the nurses specifically. This should be aimed at ensuring they are fully aware of the dangers of poor sleep health.
